# TestPackage
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Xiaozhu-Zhang1998/TestPackage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Xiaozhu-Zhang1998/TestPackage)
This is a small test package for R, including 5 functions. 

## Installation
Two methods are recommended here.

### The first method
The first method is to use `devtools::install_github()`:
  library(devtools)
  install_github("Xiaozhu-Zhang1998/TestPackage", build_vignettes = TRUE)
The package will then be stored in the default directory `.libPaths()`. 

### The second method
In cases where users might have a weak internet connection, itâ€™s often easier to download the source of the package as a zip file (from the GitHub Repo), and then to install it using `install.packages()`:
  install.packages(file.choose(), repos = NULL, type = "source")  
Users can interactively select the file they just downloaded.


## Functions
